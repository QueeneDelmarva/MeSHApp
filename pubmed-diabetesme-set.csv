27080137;2016 Jun;Diabetes mellitus and its complications in India.;India is one of the epicentres of the global diabetes mellitus pandemic. Rapid socioeconomic development and demographic changes, along with increased susceptibility for Indian individuals, have led to the explosive increase in the prevalence of diabetes mellitus in India over the past four decades. Type 2 diabetes mellitus in Asian Indian people is characterized by a young age of onset and occurrence at low levels of BMI. Available data also suggest that the susceptibility of Asian Indian people to the complications of diabetes mellitus differs from that of white populations. Management of this disease in India faces multiple challenges, such as low levels of awareness, paucity of trained medical and paramedical staff and unaffordability of medications and services. Novel interventions using readily available resources and technology promise to revolutionise the care of patients with diabetes mellitus in India. As many of these challenges are common to most developing countries of the world, the lessons learnt from India's experience with diabetes mellitus are likely to be of immense global relevance. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and its complications in India and outline the advances made in the country to ensure adequate care. We make specific references to novel, cost-effective interventions, which might be of relevance to other low-income and middle-income countries of the world.;Developing Countries, Diabetes Complications/*epidemiology/etiology/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/complications/epidemiology/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/complications/*epidemiology/therapy, Diabetes, Gestational/epidemiology/therapy, Female, Health Care Costs, Humans, India/epidemiology, Male, Pregnancy, Prevalence
9803200;1998 Oct 15;Diagnosis and classification of diabetes mellitus: new criteria.;"New recommendations for the classification and diagnosis of diabetes mellitus include the preferred use of the terms ""type 1"" and ""type 2"" instead of ""IDDM"" and ""NIDDM"" to designate the two major types of diabetes mellitus; simplification of the diagnostic criteria for diabetes mellitus to two abnormal fasting plasma determinations; and a lower cutoff for fasting plasma glucose (126 mg per dL [7 mmol per L] or higher) to confirm the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. These changes provide an easier and more reliable means of diagnosing persons at risk of complications from hyperglycemia. Currently, only one half of the people who have diabetes mellitus have been diagnosed. Screening for diabetes mellitus should begin at 45 years of age and should be repeated every three years in persons without risk factors, and should begin earlier and be repeated more often in those with risk factors. Risk factors include obesity, first-degree relatives with diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia or previous evidence of impaired glucose homeostasis. Earlier detection of diabetes mellitus may lead to tighter control of blood glucose levels and a reduction in the severity of complications associated with this disease.";Blood Glucose/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus/blood/*classification/*diagnosis/etiology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/classification/diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/classification/diagnosis, Diagnosis, Differential, Glycated Hemoglobin A/metabolism, Humans, Mass Screening, Patient Education as Topic, Risk Factors, Teaching Materials

30074235;2018;Chromogranin A and its role in the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus.;Chromogranin A is a member of the granin glycoprotein family that is expressed by the endocrine and neuroendocrine cells of different organs. Intracellularly, chromogranin A contributes to the regulation of secretion and gives several cleavage products after secretion. Some of its cleavage products modify the hormone functions in autocrine and paracrine ways, while the functions of others have not been fully understood yet. Serum chromogranin A level is most prominently used in neuroendocrine tumour diagnostics. In addition, recent studies have suggested that chromogranin A and some of its cleavage products (pancreastatin and WE-14) also play important roles in the pathogenesis of the various forms of diabetes mellitus, but their exact mechanisms still need to be clarified. Higher chromogranin A, pancreastatin, and WE-14 levels have been reported in type 1, type 2, and gestational diabetic patients compared to healthy controls. A notable connection has been inferred through the observation that type 1 diabetes mellitus is not at all or rarely developed in chromogranin A gene-knockout, non-obese diabetic model mice compared to non-knockout, non-obese diabetic mice. Pancreastatin inhibits insulin release in various cell and animal models, and WE-14 serves as an autoantigen for both CD4+ and CD8+ beta cell-destructive diabetogenic T-cell clones in type 1 diabetes. Chromogranin A contributes to the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus according to the available literature. The current findings facilitate further investigation to unravel the deeper relationships between this glycoprotein and diabetes.;Animals, Chromogranin A/*metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus/etiology/*metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental/etiology/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/etiology/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/metabolism, Diabetes, Gestational/etiology/metabolism, Female, Humans, Mice, Mice, Inbred NOD, Pregnancy

26824869;2016;Treatment Goals in Diabetes.;The quality of glycaemic control in diabetes mellitus relies on accurate individualization of available treatment options. Treatment targets depend on the type and duration of diabetes, the patients' abilities and characteristics and the individual risk for acute and/or late-stage complications. These complications include hypoglycaemia, which can be severe and life threatening, hyperglycaemia, which is a main factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, and macrovascular and microvascular disease, both of which are hallmark features of diabetes-associated constraints. Moreover, other treatment goals in diabetic patients influence both glycaemic control and quality of life.

23303908;2013 Jan;Mechanisms of diabetic complications.;It is increasingly apparent that not only is a cure for the current worldwide diabetes epidemic required, but also for its major complications, affecting both small and large blood vessels. These complications occur in the majority of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Among the most prevalent microvascular complications are kidney disease, blindness, and amputations, with current therapies only slowing disease progression. Impaired kidney function, exhibited as a reduced glomerular filtration rate, is also a major risk factor for macrovascular complications, such as heart attacks and strokes. There have been a large number of new therapies tested in clinical trials for diabetic complications, with, in general, rather disappointing results. Indeed, it remains to be fully defined as to which pathways in diabetic complications are essentially protective rather than pathological, in terms of their effects on the underlying disease process. Furthermore, seemingly independent pathways are also showing significant interactions with each other to exacerbate pathology. Interestingly, some of these pathways may not only play key roles in complications but also in the development of diabetes per se. This review aims to comprehensively discuss the well validated, as well as putative mechanisms involved in the development of diabetic complications. In addition, new fields of research, which warrant further investigation as potential therapeutic targets of the future, will be highlighted.;Animals, Blood Glucose/metabolism, Diabetes Complications/*etiology/genetics/metabolism/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*complications/genetics/metabolism/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/*complications/genetics/metabolism/therapy, Diabetic Angiopathies/etiology, Diabetic Nephropathies/etiology, Diabetic Neuropathies/etiology, Disease Models, Animal, Gene Expression Regulation, Glycation End Products, Advanced/metabolism, Humans, Inflammation Mediators/metabolism, Oxidative Stress, Prognosis, Risk Factors, Signal Transduction
31241989;2019 Aug 1;Sex differences in diabetes and kidney disease: mechanisms and consequences.;Type 1 and type 2 diabetes, along with their accompanying hyperglycemia, are associated with a multitude of comorbidities including the development of diabetic kidney disease. Although the hallmarks of these metabolic disorders have been well characterized in population and animal studies, it is becoming increasingly apparent that diabetes manifests itself differently in men and women. This review summarizes the recent diabetic literature with a focus on known sex differences in clinical and preclinical studies. It explores the physiological differences of glucose handling and the development of diabetes between men and women.

The sources of increased ROS generation in diabetes are specified, including the main pathways of altered glucose metabolism, oxidative damage to pancreatic β-cells, and endothelial dysfunction. The relationship between oxidative stress, carbonyl stress, and inflammation is described. The significance of oxidative stress reactions associated with hyperglycemia is considered in the context of the ""metabolic memory"" phenomenon. The results of our studies demonstrated significant ethnic and age-related variability of the LPO-antioxidant defense system parameters in patients with diabetes mellitus, which should be considered during complex therapy of the disease. Numerous studies of the effectiveness of antioxidants in diabetes mellitus of both types convincingly proved that antioxidants should be a part of the therapeutic process. Modern therapeutic strategies in the treatment of diabetes mellitus are aimed at developing new methods of personalized antioxidant therapy, including ROS sources targeting combined with new ways of antioxidant delivery.";Animals, Antioxidants/metabolism/therapeutic use, Diabetes Complications/*etiology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy, Diabetes Mellitus/*etiology/metabolism/pathology/*therapy, Humans, Oxidative Stress/*physiology, Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism

16898084;2006 Jul 2;[Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus].;Beside the clinical diagnosis of diabetes mellitus based on the measurement of blood glucose level, these days, the etiologic classification of the disease comes to the forefront. Genetic analysis (HLA typing, searching for glucokinase gene and mitochondrial gene mutations), immunologic examination (determination of islet specific autoantibodies) and measurement of the insulin secretory capacity help the etiologic classification. The most important result of classification is the discovery of the slowly progressive form of type 1 diabetes mellitus (formerl latent autoimmune diabetes in adults). Another direction of diagnostic procedures is the prediction of the disease in nondiabetic population. The prediction of type 1 diabetes is not specific enough at present, but that of type 2 diabetes can be done easily.;Blood Glucose/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus/*classification/*diagnosis/genetics/immunology/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/diagnosis, Glucose Tolerance Test, Humans, Insulin/metabolism, Insulin Resistance, Insulin Secretion
20723824;2010 Sep;Complications of type 1 diabetes.;The prevalence of diabetes is increasing worldwide and the concern regarding the number of new cases of diabetes relates to the development of chronic complications. It has been recognized for years that the complications are a cause of considerable morbidity and mortality worldwide and as such, negatively affect the quality of life in individuals with diabetes with an increase in disability and death. Specifically, the complications of diabetes have been classified as either microvascular (ie, retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) or macrovascular (ie, cardiovascular disease, cerebrovascular accidents, and peripheral vascular disease).

1445169;1992 Oct;Diabetes mellitus and cystic fibrosis.;There is a high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in patients with CF and this is likely to increase in the future as more patients are surviving into adult life. In view of this all CF clinics should routinely screen for diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus in adult CF patients is higher than in children, and the onset is commonly insidious. The diabetes seen in CF is not classical Type 1 diabetes or Type 2 diabetes and could more helpfully be called cystic fibrosis-related diabetes (CFRD). Treatment is by oral hypoglycaemic agents or insulin. It is not appropriate to control patients by diet alone. Dietary advice to CF diabetic patients is not the same as that given to non-CF diabetic patients.

23296171;2013 Feb; Coming full circle in diabetes mellitus: from complications to initiation.;Glycaemic control, reduction of blood pressure using agents that block the renin-angiotensin system and control of dyslipidaemia are the major strategies used in the clinical management of patients with diabetes mellitus. Each of these approaches interrupts a number of pathological pathways, which directly contributes to the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, including renal disease, blindness, neuropathy and cardiovascular disease. However, research published over the past few years has indicated that many of the pathological pathways important in the development of the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus are equally relevant to the initiation of diabetes mellitus itself. These pathways include insulin signalling, generation of cellular energy, post-translational modifications and redox imbalances. This Review will examine how the development of diabetes mellitus has come full circle from initiation to complications and suggests that the development of diabetes mellitus and the progression to chronic complications both require the same mechanistic triggers.;Animals, Blood Glucose/metabolism, Cardiovascular Diseases/drug therapy/*etiology, Diabetes Complications/*etiology, Diabetes Mellitus/drug therapy/*etiology/microbiology/*physiopathology, Gastrointestinal Tract/microbiology, Humans, Insulin/metabolism
8495594;1993 Apr;Diabetes mellitus secondary to chronic pancreatitis.;From the present review it appears that insulin-dependent diabetes is a common finding in chronic pancreatitis, and impaired secretion of insulin from beta-cells of the pancreatic islets is essential for the development of this form of secondary diabetes. Judged from a positive correlation between insulin secretory capacity and stimulated pancreatic enzyme output, beta-cell function may decrease in parallel with exocrine pancreatic function. However, in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis beta-cell function was preserved to a greater extent and glucoregulation was better than in comparable Type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients. Immunological phenomena and associations with certain HLA-alleles characterizing Type 1 diabetes mellitus were not found in insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. This may contribute to the slower destruction of the beta-cells in chronic pancreatitis than encountered in Type 1 diabetes. The small number of chronic pancreatitis patients who developed totally absence of endogenous insulin production still have some alpha-cell function during i.v. arginine and meal stimulation. However, insulin-induced hypoglycemia and insulin withdrawal did not stimulate glucagon secretion in the secondary diabetic patients in contrast to comparable Type 1 diabetics. Nevertheless, blood glucose counterregulation is intact in the secondary diabetics due to preserved catecholamine secretion. Furthermore, ketonemia develops during dissipation of insulin, in spite of absence of increased glucagon secretion, emphasizing the role of insulin dissipation for the development of ketoacidosis in this form of diabetes. The suggested increased susceptibility to severe hypoglycemia and less tendency to development of ketonemia may further be influenced by altered insulin sensitivity, nutritional factors and concomitant hepatic failure in diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatic polypeptide secretion was absent in chronic pancreatitis without endogenous insulin production. Pancreatic polypeptide secreting cells thus seem to be at least as vulnerable as the beta-cells to the destructive processes characterizing chronic pancreatitis, whereas glucagon secreting alpha-cells preserve secretory capacity to a greater extent than PP-cells and beta-cells. No data, however, favour the view that absent pancreatic polypeptide secretion has any major effect on the glucoregulation in diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. Increased plasma concentration of somatostatin was found in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes secondary to chronic pancreatitis. The source of somatostatin in the patients is unknown, but somatostatin may contribute to a reduction in overall blood glucose level in patients without endogenous insulin secretion due to inhibition of glucagon secretion.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS);Chronic Disease, Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/*etiology/physiopathology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/epidemiology/etiology/physiopathology, Diabetic Angiopathies/etiology, Diabetic Nephropathies/etiology, Diabetic Neuropathies/etiology, Diabetic Retinopathy/etiology, Humans, Pancreatitis/*complications/epidemiology/physiopathology

3556107;1987 Mar-Apr; Primary prevention of diabetes mellitus.;Diabetes mellitus is one of the chronic noncommunicable diseases that have increased markedly in this century. The discovery of insulin and other drugs for lowering hyperglycemia have certainly reduced mortality from acute complications of diabetes and improved the quality of life of many diabetic patients. Recent advances in research into the etiology and natural history of diabetes have increased our knowledge about different types of diabetes to such an extent that primary prevention of diabetes mellitus is becoming a reality. Until now, few studies have attempted to test measures for primary prevention of diabetes. Therefore, the data supporting the possibility for primary prevention are largely indirect and need to be tested in preventive trials or in community-based prevention programs. We believe, however, that the time is right to start action in populations in which the prevalence of diabetes is known to have clearly increased recently. We summarize the evidence that can be used as the scientific basis of primary prevention of diabetes mellitus.;Diabetes Mellitus/genetics/*prevention & control, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/genetics/prevention & control, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/prevention & control, Humans, Primary Prevention
17524322;2007 Apr 28; [Diabetes mellitus in children: a heterogeneous disease].;Diabetes is one of the most common chronic diseases of childhood and adolescence. Type 1, or autoimmune diabetes accounts for more than 95% of cases. Nevertheless, over the past years it has become apparent that not all cases of diabetes presenting in children are autoimmune type 1. In these cases, the diagnosis is facilitated by the fact that many rare etiologies of diabetes are associated with specific clinical syndromes or a characteristic age of onset. In addition, molecular diagnosis is becoming increasingly available for several of these disorders. This review aims to provide the general physician with some important clues to make an accurate diagnosis in these patients and understand its implication in clinical management.;Child, Diabetes Mellitus/classification/diagnosis/etiology, Humans
9171248;1997 May;Twin studies in diabetes mellitus.;Twin studies are a valuable way of determining the relative significance of genetic and environmental factors in the aetiology of disease. In diabetes mellitus, they are of importance, since the aetiologies of Type 1 (insulin-dependent) and Type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus are probably different. However the results of twin studies have not always been reliable. Strict adherence to methodological guidelines is necessary to ensure the validity of the results that are obtained. These guidelines relate to ascertainment of a twin sample, confirmation of zygosity, and effects of sampling. Critical review of twin studies in diabetes performed to date imply provisionally a very strong genetic input to the aetiology of Type 1 diabetes.

Due to space limitations, acute and late complications, as well as possible prevention of type 1 diabetes are shortly mentioned. Beside type 1 diabetes, other forms of carbohydrate intolerance occurring in children are also also included.

22242260;2011;[Post-transplantational diabetes mellitus].;Newly developed diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance are frequent post-transplantation metabolic complications. In most reports, the incidence of newly-diagnosed diabetes in such patients varies from 10 to 26%. They are at high risk of cardiovascular complications, infections, graft rejection, and impaired survival compared with recipients having normal blood glucose level. Some of the above risk factors are common for the general population (age, excess body weight, familial diabetes, afroamerican ethnicity, arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia). Specific risk factors characteristic of the post-transplantation period include the use of glucocorticoids and imunodepressants (especially tacrolimus and mTOR inhibitors) as well as infections (HCV and possibly cytomegalovirus). Screening for diabetes and evaluation of risk factors are recommended to all patients before and after transplantation. Patients of high-risk groups should be treated using non-diabetogenic protocols of immunosuppression. Achievement of normoglycemia, control of lipid levels and arterial pressure, screening for diabetes complications are indispensable components of the treatment aimed at the improvement of clinical outcome in the patients developing diabetes after organ transplantation.;Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/drug therapy/epidemiology/etiology, Humans, Organ Transplantation/*adverse effects
12603567;2003 Mar; Preparing nurses to face the pandemic of diabetes mellitus: a literature review.;Diabetes constitutes a global public health problem. Today about 135 million people are affected and it is estimated that the number in 2025 will be 300 million. AIMS: By reviewing existing literature the aim is to raise awareness among nurses, nurse educators and nursing students of the global epidemic of diabetes mellitus, its multiple underlying causes, especially social ones, and how to fight it. A further aim is to discuss the implications for future curriculum content in nurse education programmes. FINDINGS: The main underlying causes of the disease are genetic and environmental factors, such as urbanization and industrialization, as well as increased longevity and changes in lifestyle from a traditional healthy and active life to a modern, sedentary, stressful life and over-consumption of energy-dense foods. This process, labelled 'coca-colonization', is evident all over the world, although more so in developing countries. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus varies among populations due to differences in genetic susceptibility and social risk factors such as change in diet, obesity, physical inactivity and, possibly, factors relating to intrauterine development. Migrants are especially affected. Diabetes mellitus needs to be treated by a holistic approach through dietary adjustment, exercise, medication (if needed), education and self-care measures. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is a preventable disease. The main implication for nurses and nursing curricula is to change the focus from the individual with diabetes mellitus and management to prevent deterioration of health (secondary prevention), to population-based community-intervention programmes. These need to focus on health promoting activities to raise awareness among healthy people of the risk factors for diabetes mellitus. CONCLUSION: Nurses all over the world have an important role in fighting the diabetic pandemic by health promotion aimed to keep people healthy as long as possible.;Curriculum, Developing Countries/statistics & numerical data, Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/etiology/*nursing/prevention & control, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/etiology/nursing/prevention & control, Disease Outbreaks, Education, Nursing, Continuing/*methods, Health Promotion, Humans, Nurse Clinicians/*education, Urbanization

Ketosis-prone atypical diabetes that has been classified by ADA as idiopathic Type 1 diabetes or Type 1b is the most common atypical form. It is characterised by an acute initial presentation with severe hyperglycaemia and ketosis, as classical Type 1 diabetes. In the subsequent clinical course after initiation of insulin therapy, prolonged remission is often possible with cessation of insulin therapy and maintenance of appropriate metabolic control. Metabolic studies showed a markedly blunted insulin secretory response to glucose, partially reversible with the improvement of blood glucose control. Variable levels of insulin resistance are observed, especially in obese patients. Pancreatic B-cell autoimmunity is an exceptional finding. Association with type 1 susceptibility HLA alleles is variable. The molecular mechanisms underlining the insulin secretory dysfunction are still to be understood and may involve gluco-lipotoxicity processes, glucagon dysregulation, effect of stress, or may be genetically determined. The present review summarises the available clinical and metabolic features and suggests some pathogenetic hypotheses and principles of management for the ketosis-prone atypical diabetes of the Africans.";Africa/ethnology, Diabetes Mellitus/*classification/*epidemiology/*genetics/metabolism, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/*epidemiology, Humans

23383581;2012 Nov; [Disease management for diabetes mellitus to prevent the onset and progression of complications].;"We developed a new critical pathway technique and an outbound-inbound call center system. The former is to support general physicians to care for outpatients with diabetes mellitus according to practice guidelines. We employed the ""Overlay method” to develop personalized optimal critical pathways. Our overview critical pathways consist of basic sheets for regular examinations and optional sheets on which the kinds and frequencies of medical examinations are determined according to many parameters, such as methods of treatment, the severity of diabetic complications, and knowledge levels. The critical pathway is continually modified according to the change in the patient's condition. The latter is to maintain and enhance the treatment motivation of outpatients. Call center agents collect medical information, making outgoing calls using a questionnaire about the patient's health status and diabetic complications as well as receiving incoming calls. When patients do not visit on the appointment date, call center agents arrange the next consultation to prevent treatment dropout. These systems are now under evaluation in a clinical trial of outpatients with diabetes mellitus.";Continuity of Patient Care, Critical Pathways, Diabetes Complications/diagnosis/*prevention & control, Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/prevention & control/*therapy, Disease Progression, Humans
11268929;2000 Dec;Diabetes mellitus in the pre-school child.;"Diabetes mellitus presents rarely in the pre-school child and presents specific problems because of the peculiarity of the young child physiology. Pathogenesis involves the classic immunological mechanisms, with a higher incidence of other autoimmunity and family history of diabetes. Because of the rarity of the condition in this age group, the delay of the recognition of the signs and symptoms, which are often subtle at onset, determines the increased incidence of ketoacidosis. The reasons for the lower glycaemic control in this age group include the persistence of endogenous insulin, but also a more detailed involvement by the parents in organising diabetes. For the same reason ketoacidosis is an unusual occurrence after diagnosis. As to insulin therapy, three or more injections a day should be recommended, as in the older child, while the modern devices for blood glucose monitoring have proved useful to improve glycaemic control and to decrease the frequency of nocturnal hypoglycaemia, which gives particular concern given the vulnerability of the nervous system in this age group. Management of diabetes in the pre-school child may result very difficult for both parents and health carers because of the erratic daily pattern of activity, sleep and feeding; however, with a cautious strategy which involves insulin therapy, diet and monitoring it is possible to achieve satisfactorily the following aims: physical well-being of the young child, normal growth, lack of hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia, acceptable value of glycosilated haemoglobin.";Child, Preschool, Diabetes Complications, Diabetes Mellitus/diagnosis/epidemiology/etiology/therapy, Diet, Diabetic, Family Health, Female, Humans, Male

Consideration must be given to the possible presence of neuropathy, micro- and macroangiopathy and cardiovascular and cerebral disease. The primary therapy recommendations for type 2 diabetics comprise diet, weight loss and increased exercise.

12015934;2002 May;[Diagnosis, classification and cathogenesis of diabetes mellitus].;Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a metabolic disorder characterized by the presence of chronic hyperglycemia accompanied by greater or lesser impairment in the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. The origin and etiology of DM can vary greatly but always include defects in either insulin secretion or response or in both at some point in the course of disease. When characteristic symptoms of DM are clearly present and blood glucose levels are high enough, the diagnosis is usually unequivocal. However, it is important to remember that the diagnosis is made in asymptomatic patients in most cases, based on the results of routine tests. The prevalence of DM, its specific complications and the presence of other diseases that often accompany DM make this disease one of today's main social and public health problems. The great increase in information available on the etiology and pathophysiology of DM and its chronic complications has led necessarily to the revision of diagnostic criteria and reclassification of the processes involved. Revised diagnostic criteria and classifications were agreed upon in 1997 and 1998 by the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organization, respectively, and new recommendations were published. Thanks to cross-representation on the committees, the conclusions and final recommendations are, in general, very similar, although a few minor differences are present. Clarification of diagnostic criteria and better classification of patients suffering from DM should allow us to make better choices among the various treatment options available and to improve prognosis.;Blood Glucose/analysis, Diabetes Mellitus/classification/*diagnosis/etiology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/classification/diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/classification/diagnosis, Humans
21127150;2011 Feb;Personalized medicine in diabetes.;Multiple genes that are associated with the risk of developing diabetes or the risk of diabetes complications have been identified by candidate gene analysis and genomewide scanning. These molecular markers, together with clinical data and findings from proteomics, metabolomics, pharmacogenetics, and other methods, lead to a consideration of the extent to which personalized approaches can be applied to the treatment of diabetes mellitus. CONTENT: Known genes that cause monogenic subtypes of diabetes are reviewed, and several examples are discussed in which the genotype of an individual with diabetes can direct considerations of preferred choices for glycemic therapy. The extent of characterization of polygenic determinants of type 1 and type 2 diabetes is summarized, and the potential for using this information in personalized management of glycemia and complications in diabetes is discussed. The application and current limitations of proteomic and metabolomic methods in elucidating diabetes heterogeneity is reviewed. SUMMARY: There is established heterogeneity in the determinants of diabetes and the risk of diabetes complications. Understanding the basis of this heterogeneity provides an opportunity for personalizing prevention and treatment strategies according to individual patient clinical and molecular characteristics. There is evidence-based support for benefits from a personalized approach to diabetes care in patients with certain monogenic forms of diabetes. It is anticipated that strategies for individualized treatment decisions in the more common forms of diabetes will emerge with expanding knowledge of polygenic factors and other molecular determinants of disease.;Blood Glucose/metabolism, Diabetes Complications/genetics/prevention & control, Diabetes Mellitus/classification/genetics/*therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/classification/genetics/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/classification/genetics/therapy, Humans, Metabolome, Mutation, Precision Medicine, Proteome/analysis

17644210;2007 Sep;Epidemiology of diabetes mellitus in old age in Japan.;Epidemiological studies on diabetes mellitus revealed that the number of patients with diabetes mellitus is gradually increasing in Japan along with development of car society and westernization of food intake. Since prevalence of diabetes mellitus increases with aging, proportion of individuals with diabetes mellitus aged over 60 has exceeded two-third of estimated total number of patients (7.40 million in 2002) in Japan where aging of society is rapidly progressing. Type 2 diabetes mellitus is common in diabetes mellitus in old age, and there are rarely elderly patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. Prevalence of both diabetic microangiopathy and atherosclerotic vascular diseases is higher in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in the middle-aged with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, atherosclerotic vascular diseases (ischemic heart disease, cerebro-vascular disease and peripheral vascular disease) are more prevalent in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus. Many studies demonstrated that functional declines, i.e. decreases in activities of daily living, physical activity and cognitive function, deteriorated quality of life in the elderly, and functional declines are more prominent in the elderly with diabetes mellitus than in those without diabetes mellitus. In order to clarify how the elderly patients with diabetes mellitus should be treated to maintain their quality of life, a nationwide randomized controlled intervention study using 1173 Japanese elderly patients with diabetes mellitus is now performing. In summary, number of elderly patients with diabetes mellitus is overwhelmingly increasing in Japan as well as in westernized countries. It is necessary for us to treat the elderly with diabetes mellitus to maintain their function and quality of life.;Aged, Body Mass Index , Diabetes Mellitus/*epidemiology/physiopathology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/epidemiology/physiopathology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/physiopathology, Diabetic Angiopathies/epidemiology, Geography, Global Health, Humans, Japan, Prevalence
26211283;2015 Jun 3;[Classification of diabetes: an increasing heterogeneity].;Diabetes mellitus is usually subdivided into type 1 and type 2. Despite precise criteria, distinction between these two types of diabetes can be difficult because of cases with superposition of the two classes. Adults aged 20 to 40 are particularly at risk of presenting an intermediary type of diabetes and thus are subject to misclassification. The distinction between these subtypes is relevant because of the therapeutic decision and the outcome which relies on insulin supply and therefore the evolution to insulin dependence. Thus, it seems important to review a new and more accurate classification of diabetes to offer a more appropriated care to patients.;Adolescent, Adult, Age of Onset, Child, Diabetes Mellitus/*classification/epidemiology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/classification/epidemiology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/classification/epidemiology, Humans
18207116;2008 Feb;Cognition and diabetes: a lifespan perspective.;Diabetes mellitus is associated with cognitive dysfunction and abnormalities that can be seen with brain imaging. Recent studies provide important new insights into  the nature and severity of these cerebral complications that help to explain why  some patients with diabetes have clinically relevant neurocognitive morbidity, whereas most are apparently unaffected. This Personal View investigates the hypothesis that clinically relevant diabetes-related cognitive decrements mainly occur at two crucial periods in life: when the brain is developing in childhood, and when the brain undergoes neurodegenerative changes associated with ageing. Outside of these periods cognitive decrements mainly occur in patients with notable diabetes-related comorbidities, in particular microvascular or macrovascular complications. The identification of crucial periods and conditions for the development of diabetes-related cognitive decrements helps to draw the attention of physicians to individuals at risk and can direct future studies into the mechanisms that underlie these conditions.;Adolescent, Adult, Aged, Aging/physiology, Child, Child, Preschool, Cognition/*physiology, Diabetes Mellitus/epidemiology/*psychology/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/epidemiology/psychology, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/epidemiology/psychology, Humans, Infant, Middle Aged
21812811;2011 Nov;Diabetes-science, serendipity and common sense.;This paper is dedicated to young researchers in diabetes. One such person was Frederick Banting who, with his colleagues, isolated insulin in 1921, saving the lives of literally millions of people. What factors allowed Banting and other scientists to produce work that has immensely benefited the human race? I propose that it is the combination of good scientific background (the 'prepared mind'), commonly some serendipity taken with a good dose of common sense and supplemented by enthusiasm, tenacity and good mentoring, which drives the 'power of observation' and the ability to take forward the good idea. I give examples from history to support this and then discuss some of the 'truths, perspectives and controversies' within the diabetes arena when I first started in diabetes research in the late 1970s. I describe how my appetite was initially 'whetted' for research by moving to an excellent clinical research environment with encouragement to test ideas and controversies initially in a clinical research programme, followed by more scientific/basic research. The work that I performed as a young doctor and research fellow led to a lifelong professional interest in three major areas-causes and interventions for diabetes vascular disease, studies of the molecular genetics of Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes and work on diabetes in different ethnic groups. I provide a summation of my own and other people's work to demonstrate how research can be progressed and lead to patient benefit as well as providing an incredibly rewarding career. I believe that we need to encourage and put more resources into development of young doctors and scientists wishing to undertake research in our discipline. Areas ripe for much-needed clinical research programmes, for example, include work on best practice/provision of health care, application of the evidence base from clinical trials to achieve public health gains, attention to adherence issues and better-tolerated therapies. Most importantly, a greater emphasis on prevention through public health measures and 'buy in' from the whole population is urgently required.;Diabetes Mellitus/ethnology/genetics/history/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/genetics/history/therapy, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/genetics/history/therapy, History, 20th Century, History, 21st Century, Humans,Public Health/history, Research/trends

The authors investigated 45 diabetics, whose disease had been diagnosed between the age of 30-45 years. As a result of their observations they state that diabetes in this age range is heterogenous. Patients can be classified into insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent types of diabetes. Two of their patients could be classified into a newly described subtype (early onset diabetes, EOD). For the time being it seems that the exact delineation of this new diabetic subtype needs more detailed observations.;Adult, Age Factors, Diabetes Mellitus/*classification/diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1/classification/diagnosis, Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/classification/diagnosis, Female, Humans, Male, Middle Aged

Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes mellitus and the increasing understanding of genetic etiologies, we present a broad review of rare genetic forms of diabetes that have differing diagnostic and/or treatment implications from type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Advances in understanding the genotype-phenotype associations in these rare forms of diabetes offer clinically available examples of evolving precision medicine where defining the correct genetic etiology can radically alter treatment approaches.

It remains associated with a high risk of severe complications, essentially micro- and macro-vascular complications. Type 1 diabetes is an auto-immune disease that leads to the destruction of insulin-secreting B cells and therefore requires an intensive expression is favoured by inadequate lifestyle, leading to obesity. It combines a relative insulin secretory defect and insulin resistance, the latter being associated with various other cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment consists of lifestyle modifications first, then the prescription of various glucose-lowering oral drugs and finally, when requested, insulin therapy. A multi-risk intervention is mandatory to improve the cardiovascular prognosis.
