# Data Mining Project 2022: MeSH on Demand Application 

Team members: 
1. Queene Jasmine Delmarva

## Features to be Implemented 
1. MeSH Recommendation using Logistic Regression and LSTM [X]
2. Article Ranking using Cosine Similarity [âˆš] -- 30/02/2022
3. Visualization of Terms from PubMed Articles with Scripting [X]

## Progress Development 
### Wednesday, 30 March, 2022 
We've sucessfully developed the second feature of the application by using the TFIDF model. Following a reference found in Kaggle, we were able to get the top 5 articles similar to the requested article based on user input (abstract). 

We have yet to implement the other features as we are still figuring out how. But we do plan to use either the Logistic Regression or LSTM, as well as using the VOSviewer software to visualize the terms in PubMed articles.
